    <h2>About Flash</h2>
    <p>Flash is designed to provide secure messaging between users. It uses RSA and AES encryption to ensure that your messages remain private and secure.</p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Registration:</strong> When you register, RSA keys (public and private) are generated for you and stored securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Sending Messages:</strong> When you send a message, it is encrypted using AES encryption, and the AES key is further encrypted using the recipient's public RSA key.</li>
        <li><strong>Receiving Messages:</strong> When you receive a message, your private RSA key is used to decrypt the AES key, which is then used to decrypt the message content.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
